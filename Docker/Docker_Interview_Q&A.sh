Basic Docker Questions
** What is Docker, and how does it work? **

Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their 
dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. 
It uses OS-level virtualization to run multiple containers on a single host without the need for a full virtual machine.

** Docker is an open-source platform that helps developers build, test, and deploy applications using containers.
It uses OS-level virtualization to run multiple containers on a single host without the need for a full virtual machine. 
How Docker works

Containers
Docker packages software into standardized units called containers. 
Containers include all the code, libraries, system tools, and runtime needed to run an application.

Docker images
Docker images are templates that contain instructions for creating containers. 
They are read-only blueprints of the libraries and dependencies needed for an application to run. 

Docker registries
Docker registries are repositories for Docker images. Docker clients can connect to registries to
download images or upload images they've built. 

Benefits of Docker
Docker allows users to run multiple processes and apps separately. 
Docker allows users to take down part of an application to update or repair. 
Docker allows users to share processes among multiple apps. 
Docker allows users to deploy and scale applications into any environment. 
Docker tools
Docker Compose is a tool that helps users define and run multi-container applications. 

** What are the advantages of using Docker? **

Portability: Runs on any system with Docker installed.
Lightweight: Uses fewer resources compared to VMs.
Scalability: Easily scales applications across different environments.
Fast Deployment: Containers start quickly compared to VMs.
Dependency Management: Ensures applications work the same in different environments.

** What is the difference between a Docker image and a Docker container? **

A Docker Image is a blueprint that contains the application code, dependencies, and configurations.
A Docker Container is a running instance of a Docker image.
How do you create and run a Docker container?

sh
Copy
Edit
docker run -d --name my_container nginx
This command pulls the nginx image (if not already available) and runs it as a container.

**What is a Dockerfile, and how is it used? **

A Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of instructions to build a Docker image.
Example:
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx
COPY index.html /var/www/html/
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
This builds an image with Ubuntu, installs Nginx, and copies a file into the container.

**What command is used to list all running Docker containers?**

sh
Copy
Edit
docker ps
To list all containers (running and stopped):
sh
Copy
Edit
docker ps -a
How do you stop and remove a Docker container?

sh
Copy
Edit
docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>
What is the purpose of the docker-compose tool?

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container applications using a YAML file (docker-compose.yml).
What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in a Dockerfile?

CMD provides default arguments that can be overridden.
ENTRYPOINT is used when you want the container to always run a specific command.
Example:
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
ENTRYPOINT ["nginx"]
CMD ["-g", "daemon off;"]
How do you expose ports in Docker?

Using EXPOSE in a Dockerfile:
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
EXPOSE 80
Using -p flag when running a container:
sh
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
Intermediate Docker Questions
How does Docker handle networking between containers?

Docker provides different network modes:
Bridge (default): Containers can communicate with each other within the same network.
Host: Shares the host network stack.
Overlay: Used in Docker Swarm for multi-host communication.
What are the different Docker storage drivers?

aufs, overlay2, devicemapper, btrfs, zfs
overlay2 is the default in most modern Linux distributions.
What is the difference between Docker volumes and bind mounts?

Volumes: Managed by Docker, stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes/.
Bind Mounts: Maps a host directory to a container directory.
How do you persist data in a Docker container?

sh
Copy
Edit
docker volume create my_volume
docker run -v my_volume:/data my_image
How can you reduce the size of a Docker image?

Use multi-stage builds.
Use minimal base images (e.g., alpine).
Remove unnecessary dependencies using RUN apt-get clean.
What is a multi-stage build in Docker?

It helps reduce image size by using multiple FROM statements.
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM golang:alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

FROM alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /usr/local/bin/
CMD ["myapp"]
How do you manage environment variables in Docker?

sh
Copy
Edit
docker run -e ENV_VAR=value my_image
What is the difference between docker run and docker start?

docker run creates and starts a new container.
docker start restarts an existing stopped container.
How do you scale services using Docker Compose?

sh
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --scale web=3
How do you troubleshoot a failing Docker container?

Check logs: docker logs <container_id>
Inspect container: docker inspect <container_id>
Check running processes: docker top <container_id>
Advanced Docker Questions
What is the difference between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes?

Swarm is built into Docker and easier to set up.
Kubernetes is more powerful but requires additional setup.
How do you secure Docker containers?

Use non-root users inside containers.
Use read-only file systems where possible.
Scan images for vulnerabilities (docker scan).
What are Docker namespaces and control groups (cgroups)?

Namespaces isolate containers at the OS level.
cgroups limit resource usage (CPU, memory).
What is the difference between COPY and ADD in a Dockerfile?

COPY only copies files.
ADD can also handle URLs and extract tar files.
How do you handle secrets in Docker?

Use docker secret (Docker Swarm) or environment variables.
How do you optimize Docker builds for better performance?

Minimize layers in the Dockerfile.
Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files.
What is the role of docker prune, and when should it be used?

sh
Copy
Edit
docker system prune -a
Cleans up unused containers, networks, and images.
What is a Docker registry, and how do you use private registries?

A registry stores Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
To push to a private registry:
sh
Copy
Edit
docker tag myimage myregistry.com/myimage
docker push myregistry.com/myimage
How can you monitor and log Docker containers?

Use docker logs and third-party tools (e.g., Prometheus, ELK Stack).
How does Docker handle multi-container applications?

Using Docker Compose or Kubernetes to manage services.
